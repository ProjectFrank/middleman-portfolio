After finishing my undergrad last year, I never thought I’d ever see myself going back to school *again*. I’ve enrolled in the Front-End Web Development Immersive at <a href="http://hackeryou.com/" target="_blank">HackerYou</a> and I start next Monday. What's even more surprising to me is that I've decided to pursue something completely unrelated to what I spent four years of my life studying. My life leading up to this decision has definitely been interesting.READMORE

When I graduated with my BBA, I had the opportunity to start my own guesthouse business (B&B style accommodation minus breakfast). I enjoyed meeting people from all over the world and the business was very profitable. The guesthouse was heavily dependent on internet booking sites that charged commissions. In order to keep more of my revenue, I wanted to make myself a website. My brother, who is a full-stack web developer, offered to help me put together a site using a Bootstrap template and ComfortableMexicanSofa. Between managing the business, learning to code, taking pictures, and writing content for the site, it quickly became apparent that I had spread myself too thin. Unfortunately, the site was never completed. However, I learned that web development, unlike my work at the guesthouse, was something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. I got myself out of the guesthouse business this summer and I have been learning about Front-End Web Development every day since.

Prior to this summer, I have had minimal experience with coding besides working with java in highschool and building geocities sites as a kid. I've been using some amazing online resources to accelerate my learning that I'd recommend to anyone who also wants to get started along this path:

*   <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.VAwEwGRdWwE" target="_blank">Harvard CS50x</a>
*   <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent Javascript</a>
*   <a href="https://hackdesign.org/" target="_blank">Hack Design</a>
*   <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>
*   <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/" target="_blank">Git Immersion</a>
*   <a href="http://leveluptuts.com/" target="_blank">Level Up Tuts</a> (specifically the <a href="http://leveluptuts.com/tutorials/css-experiments" target="_blank">CSS Experiments Series</a>)

I’m really happy with the progress I’ve made over the last couple of months. I’ve learned a fair bit about HTML5/CSS3, regular expressions, JavaScript and jQuery. I’ve also become familiar with really awesome tools such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a>, <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/" target="_blank">Middleman</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, and of course <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>. Learning to code has so far been a mind-blowing experience. When I think about how I've only just begun to scratch the surface, I can't help but feel excited about the road ahead. I'm looking forward to working with the talented and experienced team at HackerYou and I know I'll learn lots. I'm glad I made the decision that I did and I don't think I'll ever look back.
